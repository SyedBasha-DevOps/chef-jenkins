# Jenkins Chef Cookbook Has Moved!

Hey there! The current canonical source for the Jenkins Chef cookbook is maintained by [Chef Software Inc.](https://chef.io) here:

* Source code: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/jenkins
* Supermarket: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/jenkins

The master branch has been left intact for the time being, but it is highly recommended to no longer link against this repository in the future.

Please direct any development, issues, and pull requests at the above GitHub repository. Thanks!
